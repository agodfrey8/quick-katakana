        <h2>The Three “Alphabets”</h2>
        <p>
          The Japanese language consists of three kinds of written characters: kanji, hiragana, and katakana.
          To better understand what katakana is and how it is read requires a quick lesson in how these three "alphabets" work.
        </p>
        <h3>Kanji</h3>
        <p>Kanji are the complicated pictograms people think of when they think Japanese is a difficult language.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>魚 – fish</li>
            <li>水 – water</li>
            <li>木 – tree</li>
          </ul>
        <p>
          The word "kanji" means "Chinese character" in Japanese because these characters are not originally from Japan.
          Japanese didn't have a written form until the idea of writing was introduced by the Chinese.
          Originally, all Japanese texts were written and read only in Chinese.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Chinese language was very different from Japanese though.
          Kanji could represent the meaning of a Japanese idea, but it was difficult for many to read and write.
          A Japanese writing system called man’yogana was eventually created.
          It used Chinese characters for their phonetic meaning only, so that texts could be written the same way the would be spoken in Japanese.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kanji is still widely used in Japanese today because it is more efficient to write a word in one or two characters rather than the multiple characters need to write it phonetically.
          However, it can take a very long to time to study all the characters and readings necessary to understand even basic Japanese.
          Luckily, man'yogana has two descendants collectively referred to as kana that are also used in modern Japanese.
        </p>
        <h3>Kana</h3>
        <p>
          The use of man’yogana lead to a system of Japanese writing where one character would represent one syllable.
          Unlike English where several consonants and vowels characters combine together to create a variety of syllables, each possible Japanese syllable was instead given a kanji.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kanji, however, were designed to be complex characters that represented an idea, so they were tedious to write just for their phonetic meaning.
          Man'yogana characters were simplified into the two writing systems used today called kana: hiragana and katakana.
        </p>
        <h3>Hiragana</h3>
        <p>
          Hiragana came from simplifying the cursive forms of kanji and was originally a writing style that was specifically for women.
        </p>
        <p>
          Japanese words can be written with kanji, hiragana, or romaji.
          The word "romaji" means "Roman characters" in Japanese.
          For the most part, each hiragana character can be written as a consonant-vowel pair.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>魚 – さかな – sakana – fish</li>
          <li>水 – みず – mizu – water</li>
          <li>木 – もく – moku – tree</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Hiragana is much easier to read than one might expect.
          It contains 46 base characters, but each character is always pronounced the same way.
          Therefore, it requires less memorizing than kanji and less pronunciation rules than English.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kanji is still the preferred way to write most words in Japanese though.
          Hiragana is mostly used for small, grammatical words (particles) in a sentence or instead of kanji if the character considered too difficult or uncommon.
          Sometimes small hiragana characters will be printed over kanji.  This is called furigana and is meant to help readers with difficult kanji.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hiragana could easily be learned in a day and is a very important first step to those who are serious about studying Japanese.
          But, without an understanding of the language, being able to read hiragana isn't as useful as being able to read katakana.
        </p>
        <h3>Katakana</h3>
        <p>Katakana is a similar man’yogana simplification that was developed by monks.
          It was used by men for official documents.
          In some ways, it can be thought of as English cursive since it was and still is used in more formal situations
        </p>
        <p>
          Phonetically hiragana and katakana work exactly the same.
          It's just different characters for the same syllables.
          The difference between modern katakana and hiragana is the context in which they are used.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nowadays, katakana primarily used for words that have been borrowed from other cultures, and many of these borrowed words are English.
          Instead of creating a new Japanese word with hiragana and kanji, a phonetic approximation of the borrowed word is written in katakana.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>アメリカ – amerika - America</li>
          <li>アイスクリーム – aisukurīmu – ice cream</li>
          <li>ゲーム・オブ・スローンズ – gēmu obu surōnzu – Game of Thrones</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This is where the power of learning katakana lies because katakana words are typically just English words in disguise.
          Like hiragana, katakana can be learned in day, however because it requires no knowledge of how the Japanese language works, it can also be used immediately.
