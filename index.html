        <h2>The Three "Alphabets"</h2>
        <h3>Kanji</h3>
        <p> Writing in Japan came from China.
          Many existing Japanese words were given a Chinese character called kanji in Japanese.
          These are the complicated pictograms people think of when they think Japanese is a difficult language.<p>
            <ul>
              <li>魚 – fish</li>
              <li>水 – water</li>
              <li>木 – tree</li>
            </ul>
        <p>Chinese spoken language was very different from Japanese though.  The characters only represented the Japanese meaning.
        Later, a Japanese writing system called man’yogana was created by using Chinese characters for their phonetic meaning only.</p>
